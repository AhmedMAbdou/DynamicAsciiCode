# What is The Ascii Code?
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used for representing text in computers and other devices that use text. It assigns numeric codes to represent characters, with each code corresponding to a particular character, such as letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters.

## What is the idea of this project?
we make this project to make easy to get ascii code for any letter or number that user write it without nedding to search on different websites.

### What is the difference between Constant Ascii Code & Dynamic Ascii code?
-in Constant Ascii Code, we make string contain letters, numbers and sympols that we selected it.
-but there in (Dynamic Ascii code), program asks user to enter any input he want to know the Ascii of it, and store the input in variable (input) then print the Ascii easily.
